## About
Connect to an existing database, and query the database.

## Getting Started
All necessary files are located in this sqlalchemy-challenge repository. 

The SurfsUp folder contains a file named climate_starter.ipynb which contains the code to query and analize the hawaii databases. The file app.py contains the code for routing api calls.

The Resources folder contains the csv files for filling the data tables in climate_starter.ipynb and the hawaii.sqlite used for gerating respnsonses to api calls.


## Installing
This was generated using jupyter lab and visual studio on a Windows 10 Pro system.


## Usage
Run climate_starter.ipynb in jupyter lab.
Run app.py in a (dev) environment in gitbash at the file's location using:    python app.py
Cut and past the gererated url into a web browser. Add the list of available routes to the url one at a time.


## Contributing
Thank you to CG:AF at Central Grading for refering me to https://community.codenewbie.org/kwing25/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-project-16ej. I have used this as a template instead of the template from the Gitlab repository for class. Hopefully y'all like it better.

https://stackoverflow.com/ was useful for remembering how to create charts and manipulate dataframes.
The lecture materials were my biggest guide.
